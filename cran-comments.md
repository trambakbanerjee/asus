## New submission
This is a  new submission. 

## Test environments
* ubuntu 12.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.4.1
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
There were NO ERRORs, NO WARNINGs. 

There were 2 NOTES:

* checking CRAN incoming feasibility ... NOTE
Maintainer: 'Trambak Banerjee <trambakb@usc.edu>'

This is a harmless note.

* checking top-level files ... NOTE
Files 'README.md' or 'NEWS.md' cannot be checked without 'pandoc' being installed.

I can put these in .Rbuildignore but CRAN supports NEWS.md now.
